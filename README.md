Note:

This assignment was specifically focused on frontend development, and all features, including user management, role management, and permission management, were implemented using React and related tools.

However, I also have hands-on experience in backend development using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. In past Internship and projects, I have worked on:

- Building secure and scalable RESTful APIs.
- Implementing user authentication and authorization.
- Designing robust database schemas for efficient data management.

This expertise enables me to work seamlessly across the full-stack development spectrum when required. While this assignment showcases my frontend skills, my backend knowledge enhances my ability to collaborate effectively on end-to-end projects.
